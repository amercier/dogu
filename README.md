Introduction
------------

Dogu is a modular application that exposes a REST API (_core_) and a Web 
application (_ui_). Each of them are using the HTTP protocol and are accessed
from a unique entry point (one for the _ui_, one fore the _core_):

  - http://api.dogu-demo.com - REST API
  - http://www.dogu-demo.com - Web application

This application contains several modules. The application core is divided into
two modules: _dogu-core-api_ and _dogu-core-ui_. These two modules expose the
HTTP services but are empty - they are just containers for _plugin_ modules.


Following the same pattern,
each plugin is divided into two modules: one for the _api_, one for the _ui_.
For instance the plugin _history_ contains two modules:

  - _dogu-plugin-history-api_ - Additions to the REST API
  - _dogu-plugin-history-ui_ - Additions to the Web Application
